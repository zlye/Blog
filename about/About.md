<font size="12"> I'm a data scientist and computational biologist living in New York City! </font>

<font size="14"> I decided to pursue my Ph.D. when I learned that I loved sifting through genetic sequencing data to derive insights about how species evolved. At the time I was working on a project about apple domestication. Before that I always thought I was too clumsy to be a serious biologist - I was constantly spilling things, dropping test tubes, and crushing the study specimen on accident (to the chagrin of my lab partners). </font>

<font size="16"> During my Ph.D. I worked with a broad range of data types to uncover evolutionary trends in gene expression. I am most proud of my work that demonstrated how rare genetic variants are associated with dysregulation in gene expression. This work has important implications for understanding stress responses and how plant breeders can conceptualize the role of rare genetic variation in traits. </font>

<font size="20"> Today I want to transfer my computational skills from unraveling the mysteries of evolution to solving the problems that affect people and businesses from day to day.</font>
